### Dataset Used

This project uses the **1000_Companies.csv** dataset from Kaggle for training the ML model.

To retrain the model, download it from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirajvermafcb/startups

The trained model is already saved in `backend/model/profit_model.pkl`, so you don't need the CSV file to run the API.
